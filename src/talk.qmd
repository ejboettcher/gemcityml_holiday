## AI Image Generation Fun

AI Images are pretty amazing but I still think you need a human.

### Thoughts

I liked Fotor the best for the image it created.

But DAL-E was the only one that had a pull tab

### Winner of Dayton AI

December's Machine Learning Group will be loosely based on GANs. GANs (generative adversarial networks) are a class of machine learning frameworks where neural networks (NN) compete in a zero sum game.

In this spirit, I am having a competition of AI generated Dayton Themed Art.

Break down:

* Generative Model: Your choice
* Discriminator Model: Your Peers
* Training set: Your rich knowledge of Dayton
* Output: Dayton Themed GAN's / AI generated Art
* Prizes: Bragging rights! and choice of a frame-able print or T-shirt of the BEST Dayton themed art.

### Voter Turnout
Voter turnout was low, many people had two votes (likes) and no one had three.

* Need better voter turnout or better cheaters.

If same person had two entries that were winners, I chose one.
I like the results, because it does how the diverseness of Dayton.
