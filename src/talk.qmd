## AI Image Generation Fun

AI Images are pretty amazing but I still think you need a human.

## AI Gen a comparison

Going to use the key work
"Pull Tab Christmas Tree" and see how they images differ.

### Why pull Tab?

It was invented in Dayton

## Ermal Fraze

He started his career in Dayton Ohio as a machine tool operator in the 1940s.
Using a loan from his wife, Martha, he established the Dayton Reliable Tool & Manufacturing Company,
 his own machine tool business in 1949. The company produced tools such as improved gun barrels for war planes, including the NASA, General Electric, and Ford.[3]

Fraze patented many of his innovations later graduated from Kettering University.
In 1959, while at a picnic with friends and family, Fraze discovered he had left his "church key"
can opener at home, forcing him to use a car bumper to open cans of beer.
Fraze decided to create an improved beverage opening method that would eliminate
the need for a separate device, leading to his creation of the **pull-tab opener**.

His first design included a lever that pierced a hole in the top of the can,
but this caused a safety hazard as it produced sharp edges that could cut the user's finger.
Later that year, he established a mechanism known as the "pull-tab" can, with its users simply
being required to pull a removable tab to open the drink.

He received U.S. patent No. 3,349,949 for the invention in 1963, and subsequently sold it to Alcoa.
By 1965, around 75% of U.S. breweries were using them, but in the mid-1970s, pressure from environmentalists due to litter led to the development of the non-removable tabs used today. By 1980,
his company was supplying can-end machinery worldwide making over $500 million in annual revenue

### Thoughts

I liked Fotor the best for the image it created.

But DAL-E was the only one that had a pull tab

### Winner of Dayton AI

December's Machine Learning Group will be loosely based on GANs. GANs (generative adversarial networks) are a class of machine learning frameworks where neural networks (NN) compete in a zero sum game.

In this spirit, I am having a competition of AI generated Dayton Themed Art.

Break down:

* Generative Model: Your choice
* Discriminator Model: Your Peers
* Training set: Your rich knowledge of Dayton
* Output: Dayton Themed GAN's / AI generated Art
* Prizes: Bragging rights! and choice of a frame-able print or T-shirt of the BEST Dayton themed art.

### Voter Turnout
Voter turnout was low, many people had two votes (likes) and no one had three.

* Need better voter turnout or better cheaters.

If same person had two entries that were winners, I chose one.
I like the results, because it does how the diverseness of Dayton.

## Talking points

* Did you use a text-image interpreter
* What tricks did you use
* Did you use a seed?
* Did you use your own?
