gemcityML 2022 December Meetup

## Details

Zero Sum Games (but one real winner!)
December's Machine Learning Group will be loosely based on GANs. GANs (generative adversarial networks) are a class of machine learning frameworks where neural networks (NN) compete in a zero sum game.

In this spirit, I am having a competition of AI generated Dayton Themed Art.

### Break down:

* Generative Model: Your choice
* Discriminator Model: Your Peers
* Training set: Your rich knowledge of Dayton
* Output: Dayton Themed GAN's / AI generated Art
* Prizes: Bragging rights! and choice of a frame-able print or T-shirt of the BEST Dayton themed art.
* Number of prizes: 1
* Ends: Dec 9th 2022 Midnight, for a prize. But for bragging rights, that Dec 15th 2022 at 6pm.

NOTE: Everything subject to change. Except this is supposed to be fun.

How to win: Post you Dayton themed AI generated art on the Gem City Tech's Discord server under Machine Learning. The person with the most votes (in form of thumbs up) wins.

FYI: I will be highly biased if you build a NLP in python using Dunbar's works to create new poetry. You will be an automatic winner. In this case, there will be two winners. Oh the mask we wear.

I will have a side by side comparison of some of the Image Generators and how they compare using the same text "Pull Tab Christmas Tree".
Would LOVE to see your comparisons too!

You can also connect anytime through Gem City Tech Discord Server.
Always looking for suggestions for next talk.
The Gem City Machine Learning (ML) group is part of the GemCity TECH family of user communities.
Each month we meet at the Innovation Hub located in the newly renovated Dowtown Dayton Arcade.
We meet to explore the exciting and growing field of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
We regularly meet on the third Thursday of the month. You can find our next event on the GemCity TECH Meetup events calendar.

Would you like to discover more about machine learning or artificial intelligence?

* Are you interested in being part of a community who are also interested in exploring the field of machine learning?
* Do you work in the field of machine learning and would like to share your knowledge and experience?
* Our goal is to have a space where people can present and learn new ML/AI ideas,
ask for help on problems they are working on, and meet new people.

We have short talks about machine learning (ML) and how to get into this field.

The format is:

* Social: ~ 30 min
* Lecture: ~ 1 hour
* Social: ~ 30 min
